# Amazon ML Model


## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model designed for the Amazon ML Challenge. The objective of the challenge is to extract entity values from product images accurately. The model utilizes advanced feature extraction techniques and deep learning architectures to achieve high precision.

## Problem Statement
In digital marketplaces, product images often lack detailed textual descriptions, making it difficult to extract structured information. This project aims to develop an AI-based solution that can analyze product images and extract key attributes such as brand, category, and specifications.

## Features
- **Feature Extraction**: Implements advanced image processing techniques to extract meaningful features.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers for accurate predictions.
- **Efficient Training Pipeline**: Optimized training pipeline with hyperparameter tuning.
- **Dataset Handling**: Scripts to preprocess and clean image datasets.
- **Prediction & Submission**: Generates submission-ready predictions in CSV format.
